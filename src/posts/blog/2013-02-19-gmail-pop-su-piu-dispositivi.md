<p>Using POP on multiple clients or mobile devices<br />
What is &#8216;recent mode?&#8217;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re accessing Gmail on multiple clients through POP, Gmail&#8217;s &#8216;recent mode&#8217; makes sure that all messages are made available to each client, rather than only to the first client to access new mail.</p>
<p>Recent mode fetches the last 30 days of mail, regardless of whether it&#8217;s been sent to another POP client already.</p>
<p>Setting up &#8216;<strong>recent mode</strong>&#8216;</p>
<p>In your POP client settings, <em><strong>replace &#8216;username@gmail.com&#8217; in the &#8216;Username&#8217; or &#8216;Email&#8217; field with &#8216;recent:username@gmail.com&#8217;</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you enable recent mode, please be sure to configure your POP client to leave messages on the server according to the instructions below:</p>
<p>Outlook or Outlook Express: on the Advanced tab, check the box next to &#8216;Leave a copy of messages on the server.&#8217;<br />
Apple Mail: on the Advanced tab, remove the check next to &#8216;Remove copy from server after retrieving a message.&#8217;<br />
Thunderbird: on the Server Settings tab, check the box next to &#8216;Leave messages on server.&#8217;</p>
